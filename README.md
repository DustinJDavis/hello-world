# hello-world
This is my first Github repository
My names is Dustin and I am taking an online basic Python/Computer Programming course through EdEx/Michigan State U. As part of the requirements of this course I am setting up a Github profile and linking it ot the Atom text editor. I was also advised by a mentor to volunteer as a shitwork Grunt (Wrangling, Pulls, etc.) on Github projects to improve my coding abilities. Take care and happy coding!
